//This Test class includes the following Unit Tests:
//1. `testSendRequestSuccess`: Tests the successful sending of a request and receiving a response.
//2. `testSendRequestFailure`: Tests the failure case when sending an empty request.
//3. `testSendRequestEmptyResponse`: Tests the failure case when receiving an empty response.
//4. `testSendRequestError`: Tests the failure case when encountering an error during the request.
//5. `testSendRequestModel`: Tests additional assertions related to the model used for sending requests and receiving responses.
//
//Note: You may need to modify the assertions and expectations based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
